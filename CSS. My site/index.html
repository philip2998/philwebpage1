      <h3>Chess</h3>
      <p>I have always been interested in chess from an early age, I have watched how they play and learned on my own. I think I'm good at chess. The game makes you think, non-stop. Find the right options, identify the mistakes. It will also help in programming.</p>

      <h3>Playing Football</h3>
      <p>Like chess, football seems to have a similar history to me. The first is a mental game, the second is physical. I think it is necessary to combine those two, it is important for me. It's true that I don't play football much now, but it has a primary role for me.</p>
